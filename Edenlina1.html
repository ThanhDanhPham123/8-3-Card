            <p>I am not that good with word if I have to be totally honest. It's true that I have given you some gifts,
<br> but those are things I bought with money, some from my parents and some from my part-time job. However, <br>
I don't feel that those gifts are enough to show how I truly feel. So I decided to make this digital card (I made the template from scratch a while ago and<br>
edited and imporved it for this occasion)<br>
Enough rambling though, I have so many things to tell you, even after all the texts, all the night calls. I cannot say all the of them in this card. But if I have to say something,<br>
I would say that, the decision to texted you that day was one of my best decisions. I love every moment talking to you, I love listening to all your stories, from random reels and funny bits in your day, to serioud<br>
and deep-rooted trauma. Everything has made me more appreciative of you. At first, I saw you as a funny and a little annoying freshman. Gradually, learning and talking more with you, I realized that you are so much more special than that<br>
You are a beautiful person, a taleted artist, a chaotic and funny munchkin, and a girl with a loving heart.<br>
Seeing your smile, my heart always skipped a beat. I enjoy seeing you happy, to see you shine and thrive in your new school environment.<br>
From a casual friend, you have become more than that to me, something I cannot imagine losing right now.<br>
Thank you for being a part of my life,Edenlina-Thanh Mai.❤️❤️❤️<br></p>
