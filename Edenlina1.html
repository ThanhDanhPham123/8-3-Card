            <p>	I think you may be surprised when seeing this, but yeah, I can change the message from my home computer, so I'm doing it right now<br>
I actually want to say this another time when we are meeting in real life, if I have a chance, I will do this in real life again <br>
maybe even twice.<br>
My dear Edenlina<br>
	I didn't think I would say this from the first day I met you. You were such an interesting person and a cool friend, and I thought you and I would stay like that.<br>
But as we talked more, as I get to know you more and more, your personalities, your characters, your loving heart, your funny humor, everything about you makes me can't stop thinking about<br> 
	I know you are still somewhat shadowed by your past; rough years are not as easy to overcome as many might think, and I understand that. I will accept everything you have to bring to the table<br>
since it is what this type of commitment will require.<br>
	I know I am not the best partner, appearance and personalities wise. You have probably seen some and will probably see more of that aspect of me. But I promise, I am absolutely certain that<br>
I can and will absolutely be better for you, will become my best version for you.<br>
	Our future is full of different possibilities, and it's understandable to worry about it, but I want to accompany you on this part of life and maybe the future<br>
as something more than a casual friend. So please don't worry because, unless you hate and left me on your on accord, I will stay, I will be by your side, and we will uplifting each other.<br>
	You can probably guess what I'm about to say, and I won't make you wait anymore. But I still want to make this extra special<br>
	Edenlina Lopez-Pháº¡m Thanh Mai, whichever name you want me to refer to you by, whenever you want me to be by your side, despite you being happy or sad, I will be there, always<br>
Because: I LIKE YOU, I LIKE YOU A LOT, MORE THAN I CAN PUT INTO THESE WORDS.<br>
	I would want to enter a new stage of our relationship, it can be happy, sometimes even sad and scary, but I will be by your side and always have your back<br>
	So, would you want to become my girlfriend?<br>
	Whatever your answer is, thank you for reading this, and thank you for being such a beautiful color of my life.</p>
